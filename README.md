# PlusD Clone 1.6

ZX PlusD clone for all ZX Spectrum computers.

# November 25, 2020

* The solder pad used to select the floppy drive controller IC has been removed.
The floppy drive controller IC's that can be used are: WD1772-02-00, WD1772-02-02 & VL1772-02PC
* Some minor changes.

# October 16, 2020

* Resistors, capacitors (except the two electrolytics) & diodes now are SMD 1206
* Some minor changes

# September 25, 2020

* In this version the solder pads to select the READY signal has been removed.
* Now you can fin a connector of 4x2 pins to put the jumpers.
     
     * Upper row: Cable selector (AT or Shugart)
     * Bottom row: READY signal selector, REAL or EMU
      
     See attached pictures.

# July 27, 2020

Tested & working 100%
* In this version of the board the IC 7805 has been removed. The interface power is taken from the + 5V line of the expansion bus.

# July 11, 2020

* Corrected footprint of U2 (W27E257)
* Everything seems to be OK. Ordering 5 PCB's to test.

# July 6, 2020

* Added a SPDT switch ON-ON to select between ZX 48K/128K & +2A/+3
* Inversion of Drive 1 and Drive 2 now is made by a DPDT Switch (ABBA)
* Now the IC12 (L7805) can be placed horizontally
* Relocation of LEDS, NMI and RESET pushbuttons and some IC's
* Added three 3M holes (3.5mm) to facilitate the fixation on a case
* Kempston Joystick connector now is horizontal
* Changed the DIP switch for ROM selection and Joystick ON-OFF for a DIP Switch Piano style.
* Electrolytic capacitors are now SMD

# Notes

Two types can be used as the IC for floppy disk controller: WD1772 (versions 02-00 and 02-02) and VL1772-02PC.
Unfortunately, they are difficult to find at reasonable prices.

The advantages of this interface over the original are:

* 4 Banks of ROM, so you can swap between G+Dos and Unidos, selectable by dip-switches
* Included Fixed for +2A/+3, so can be used in any ZX Spectrum, selection by switch
* Kempston Joystick Interface included, can be disable by dip-switch
* Reset Button
* Posibility of use crossed or plain floppy cable, and invert Drive 1 and Drive 2, very usefull if you have a Gotek and a real floppy.
